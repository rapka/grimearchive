Bare wastemen wanna dis my tune, same MCs wanna spit on my tune
Jump in my GT- zing zing zoom, See me on TV real real soon
Sit back in your throne, turn off your phone, ‘cause this is our zone
It’s a serious ting, no joke, no laughter
Walk in the room, spray what I like
Wanna clash me then you better come proper
You thought I was a first timer, I am the roll deep grimer
Getting’ quite big in the scene, got a couple of big hooks
Chuckin' MC's like stones, Bad Boy Forever like Sean Puffy Combs
I wanna get paid in full! No time for chitchat, no time for ball!
I’m just trying to function.
MC’s my trade, chat ‘nuff heat when the tune is played
There’s plenty more fish in the sea, that’s why I got my rod in it
Man wanna run off their mouth online
Why invest in guns when you can just invest in a brand new sound?
Who’s on the riddim, on the radio? It’s me with the ruff neck flow!
Legendary, been a bad boy since secondary
I’m cold but my lyrics den a blazin’!
Demonstrate, innovate, never imitate
Cause when it comes to music we are di gorgon
Don’t let your pride or ego take control
